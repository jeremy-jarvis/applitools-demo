## Install Node and NPM
If you are using Windows or macOS, [see instructions here](https://nodejs.org/en/) for how to install Node and NPM.  Note: NPM will be installed as part of the Node installer.

For Ubuntu, there are [several ways](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-20-04) to install Node and NPM. One simple way is using the Ubuntu package repository:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs
sudo apt install npm
```

## Configure NPM (on Ubuntu/Linux)
When you try to install global packages, you might get an error that permission is denied. This might be because you donâ€™t have access to the location on your machine where NPM is trying to install the global packages, such as `/usr/local/lib/node_modules`.

If this happens, you could use `sudo` when you install global packages, but that might cause further permissions issues later. A better approach is to configure your global `node_modules` directory to be in a location that you have permission to:

```
mkdir ~/.npm-global
npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'
Add to path in ~/.profile:~/.npm-global/bin
EXAMPLE: export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH
source ~/.profile
```

Now, when you install global packages using NPM, they will reside under your home directory at `~/.npm-global`. For more info on this, see [the answer to this question on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33725639/npm-install-g-less-does-not-work-eacces-permission-denied)
